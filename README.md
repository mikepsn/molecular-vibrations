Computational Physics paper on Semi-Classical Quantization of Molecular Vibrations.

This paper was written in 1997 as the first project (out of 5) in a 3rd year undegraduate
physics class I took in Computational Physics. 

The paper was reformatted to use an IEEE template and an abstract was added.
So apart from the adding of figures/table environments and changing the source code 
listings to use a modern LaTeX package (listings) the paper is otherwise unchanged.
I still need to fix the Appendix references to the source code however. 

The code for the class had to be written in FORTRAN 77 which I have included in the repository,
but I haven't got around to getting a FORTRAN compiler to compile it up and see if it still
works.
